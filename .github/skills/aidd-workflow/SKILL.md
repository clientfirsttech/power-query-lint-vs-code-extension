# AIDD Workflow — fabric-ci-cd-dataops

Project-specific command router. Read this file to discover which skills to load for each user command in this Python + Microsoft Fabric project.

## Pre-Flight

Constraints {
  Always read vision.md before executing any task or plan command
  (vision conflict detected) => stop, explain the conflict, ask user to resolve before proceeding
  (project language is Python) => skip JS/TS skills: aidd-javascript, aidd-lit, aidd-react, aidd-autodux, aidd-ecs
  (task involves Fabric deployment) => load fabric-cicd-deployment first
  (task involves code changes) => use aidd-tdd — write tests before implementation
  All skills resolve to: .github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
  Epic files: tasks/<epic-name>-epic.md
}
